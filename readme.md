## Just experimenting for the time being

This project aims to create a dependently-typed language interpreter in Javascript to enable native 'certifiable' (i.e. provable) programs.

For the most part, the nuts and bolts have been and are being lifted wholesale from Andres Loeh's LambdaPi and Stephanie Weirich's Pi-Forall.

I'm dreaming of implementing cubical types so proofs can be transported from the peano naturals to (positive) big ints. Maybe native Javascript functions and types can be incorporated as builtins in a systematic way?

I like the promise of efficiency from using interaction nets as well so I'm also planning to yoink that from moonad/Formality at some point.
